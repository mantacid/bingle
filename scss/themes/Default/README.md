##### Author: Mantacid

## `anim.scss`
Defines mixins for animations and transitions. these don't set the value of `transition-property`, so be sure to define that when you `@include` them.

## `colors.scss`
Defines colors used by the theme.

## `fonts.scss`
WIP

## `geom.scss`
Defines the shapes and layouts of UI elements.

## `icon.scss`
Defines styles and special colors of icons. Also sets the `-gtk-icon-theme` property.

## `main.scss`
Acts as an index for all other stylesheets, allowing the theme to be `@import`ed with a single statement.
