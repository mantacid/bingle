;; WIP. Each app will provide json that dictates their menu.

;; this can also be rendered in a MacOS-like topbar, as both it and any windows would be querying the focused application for its menu data anyway.
(defwidget topMenu [optJSON]
  (box :class ""
       :orientation "h"
       :hexpand true
       :halign "start"
    (for menuItems in optJSON
      (button "placeholder")
    )
  )
)
