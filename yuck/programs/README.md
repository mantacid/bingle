# `programs/`
This Directory contains yuck used to render various applications and GUIs. Each application gets their own directory, which may optionally also contain stylesheets (to preserve branding, for example). The app directories should also contain any scripts they need to function.

## `manifest.yuck`
Serves to document all application yuck the system should be aware of (to render in an app menu for example). May get switched out for a `.json` format later.
